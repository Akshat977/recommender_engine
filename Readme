THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS THE JUPITER NOTEBOOK OF A RECOMMENDER ENGINE I MADE. THIS ENGINE CAN DO THE FOLLOWING TWO THINGS:
TAKE A LIST OF WATCHED MOVIES AS AN INPUT AND:
1. DISPLAY TOP MOVIES OF ALL TIME BASED ON POPULARITY AND RATINGS AND SUGGEST ONES WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN WATCHED
2. DISPLAY SIMILAR MOVIES BASED ON THE CONTENT YOU HAVW WATCHED AND THE RATING ON THOSE MOVIES. ALSO, PREDICT THE RATING WHICH WILL BE GIVEN TO THOSE UNSEEN MOVIES.
